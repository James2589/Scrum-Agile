# Scrum-Agile
This is a Scrum-Agile Review and Retrospective from my SDLC class.


#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

In order to properly interpret user needs first you need to understand what the project is meant to accomplish. The product owner would be able to help in understanding the project goals. Once you have an understanding of the project "user stories" give a simple easy to understand objective that can then be used to implement the user needs into the project. User stories allow for prioritization of work and give the development team a way to organize and plan sprints during sprint planning. 


#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I like to approach developing programs incrementally, breaking the overall project down into smaller chunks that I can then work on. I dont have a lot of experience programming so by working on smaller pieces of the overall project I am able to focus my research on a small piece opposed to jumping around and getting lost in the overwhelming amount of information that there is on programming. Agile offers a lot of different processes that I think could be useful but one of the key things that I would like to incorporate is the flexibility aspect. Agile may not work in every scenario so becoming "Rigid" or "stuck in my ways" would ultimitely hinder my progress, remaining flexible will allow me to adjust to the needs of the project and/or workplace. 


#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member can mean a lot of things, I think one of the most important ones is being independent while also remaining humble. As a new developer I can't expect to have my hand held I need to be able to complete work on my own. This means finding my own resources and doing my own research, while also understanding my limits. There is nothing wrong with asking questions and should be encouraged but if you cant do anything on your own you are hindering the team. Another important aspect is taking ownership and responsibility while the team may have overall responisibility you never want to be dragging the team down by completing subpar work. You should be doing your best to support the teams goals. Finally sharing knowledge betweens members is very important to the team, by developing the individual members of a team the team will ultimitely grow and perform better overall.
